# RedBus Bus Reviews Scraper and Analysis using Streamlit
This project automates the extraction of APSRTC and TGSRTC bus listings and passenger reviews from the RedBus website using Selenium, processes the collected data, and generates insights for travel analytics. The system scrolls through routes, loads up buses, extracts detailed reviews, ratings, and service parameters, and saves everything into a structured dataset for further analysis.

A Streamlit application is built on top of the scraped data to explore buses, compare services, view sentiment trends, and analyze passenger feedback interactively.
